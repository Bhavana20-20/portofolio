            <p class="text-muted text-left">For two Decades after its inception St. Xavier’s was primarily an English medium School.
                The medium of instructions as well as communication was primarily English. The School catered to the educational
                needs of the elite and thus it maintained its high standard through imparting education in English. During this
                time English – both written and spoken - was more emphasized so that our students would be able to compete with
                other the schools of great reputation.</p>

            <hr>
           <p class="text-muted text-left">But by late 70’s and early 80’s there was a growing awareness among 
                the Jesuits to help the poor by empowering them through education. Hence most of the Jesuit 
                schools began admitting students from the lower strata of the society. In order to facilitate 
                the education of poor students the medium of instruction too had to be followed in Mother tongue. 
                Thus from 1980 onwards the medium of instruction was changed to Hindi up to class 5. The Jesuit 
                educators also realized that education is imparted best in one’s own mother tongue. Difficult 
                concepts are better assimilated when it is imparted through one’s mother tongue.</p>

            <hr>
            <p class="text-muted text-left">But in the context of globalization in 1990’s and the IT boom that 
                started in India, the Jesuit educators gave a re-thinking on the policy of medium of instruction. 
                The utility of English became all the more prominent when India became a destination for global 
                investment. Once again English language became predominantly the global link language for education 
                nd business. Hence there arose the need to focus more on learning English,Hence in 2009 the medium 
                of instruction was reverted to English and the new policy was implemented from the year 2010. 
                Now St. Xavier’s is a fully English medium School.</p>

                     even learn from home, and as it is in school they can ask their doubts and get answers immedently in face time 
                     and the class can be interactive. They can even learn computer skills by online classes.As, the pandemic is too 
                     serious when it gets to normal we are planning the reopening of schools,as the online classes can cause some 
                     health issues like eye pain and backpain we are trying to reduce the timings of the class.And also the 
                     teachers can share the videos live and make students learn about the chapter more deeply.

                    their ward through SMS like weather their are present or not,their marks, their performance in classes etc.... 
                    Also their parents are able to know the information very soon and they no need to attend the parents teacher's meeting 
                    as they recive information through SMS and it is a save of time too.So it benifits a lot to the parents and even the
